# Picturez
Picturez is a cross-platform and open source tool to edit, trim, filter, convert and/or resize many pictures in one step. Furthermore, it has a steganography component. It works very memory space-saving and has a modern (GTK#-based) graphical user interface. It is based on Mono/.NET 4.5 and consists of three parts: 
 
1. Picturez editor
2. Picturez converter
3. Picturez steganography
 
The advantage of Picturez is the very easy handling. You can use it just by right-clicking on a picture or folder and using the explorer context menu (Linux and Windows). </br>
Note: For running Picturez since version 3.0 on Windows, you have to install .NET 4.5 (already included in Win8.1 and Win10) as well as GTK-Sharp v2.12. Download: <a href="http://download.xamarin.com/GTKforWindows/Windows/gtk-sharp-2.12.30.msi" target="_blank">gtk-sharp-2.12.30.msi</a> or from <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/#download-win" target="_blank">Mono website</a>. For linux users there is no need to install anything. In common distributions Mono and GTK-Sharp are already included.
